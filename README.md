NetUnitTestComparison
=====================

Comparison between MSTest, NUnit 3 and XUnit.NET 2. At time of writing XUnit.NET is in beta and NUnit is in alpha.

All tests are runnable using Visual Studio or Resharper (even though Resharper does not support NUnit 3 yet). Also, for XUnit.NET you need to install the XUnit.NET test runner extension via the Jetbrains Extension Manager.
